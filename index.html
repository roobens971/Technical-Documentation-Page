						<p>Le développement Web est le travail impliqué dans le développement d'un site Web pour Internet ou un intranet. Le développement Web peut aller du développement d'une simple page statique de texte brut à des applications Internet complexes, des entreprises électroniques et des services de réseaux sociaux.</p>

						<h2>What you should already know</h2>
					</header>
			
						<code></code>
					<p>1. HTML/CSS/JS
						The most important skill or knowledge every developer should learn first is these three basic building blocks i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will be using HTML and CSS in frontend for interfaces. Just right click on your web browser and then select view page source option. You will find the structure of your website where a lot of HTML tags are used for different purposes.
						CSS is also used in the frontend that decides the style, design, layout and how HTML elements need to be displayed on the screen.
						Javascript is high in demand nowadays and it is basically responsible for making your HTML pages dynamic and interactive. Javascript also comes with a variety of languages like PHP, Python, ASP.Net to make your website more interactive. If you’re gonna specialize in javascript like MEAN Stack or MERN stack then you’re gonna deep dive into this language because this one will be your frontend as well as backend language.</p>
						<br><br>

						<p>2. Git and Github
						Git is one of the most popular version control systems which is used in most of the organization. Chances are higher that you need to work on this version control if you get a job as a web developer. This is the reason you should definitely spend some time learning Git and some basic commands like cloning, pushing to repositories, making a pull request, merging branches, etc.
						Github is a service where you can push your Git repositories to host your code. It is used for collaboration or we can say it allows developers to work together on projects.</p>
						<br><br>

						<p>3. Programming Languages
						Computers don’t understand human languages and that’s the reason you need to talk to your system with the programming languages. In web development, programming languages are compulsory to learn and all the logics you can apply using a wide range of programming languages. Web developers use a variety of languages like PHP, Python, Java, Ruby and recently Javascript also giving competition introducing itself to handle the backend part. As a web developer, you must have knowledge of at least one programming language to build your web application.</p>
						<br><br>

						<p>4. Problem Solving and Searching
						If you want to become a web developer you should have some natural problem solving and searching skills. Problem-solving and searching skill can be built through some projects, through data structures and algorithms, solving some challenges, puzzles and stuff like that but you need to keep practicing whatever you choose.
						No matter if you are a beginner or experienced, in web development, you will be searching for the information, syntax or solution for some problems a lot while building the application. You will definitely encounter some strange errors, you are completely unaware of and there you need to take the help of google or stackoverflow like communities to solve the problem.</p>
						<br><br>

						<p>5. Writing Tests
						A lot of developers consider this useless and a waste of time. For the small application, you can ignore writing tests but if you are building a large application we recommend you to write tests like unit tests and other types of the test because it helps in making your whole process robust and debugging become easier. Initially, you will be feeling like you are wasting your time but later you will realize it actually save your time, so make a habit of writing tests while building your application.</p>

					<h2>How to learn coding</h2>
				</header>

						<code></code>
						<p>Step 1: Work Out Why You Want To Learn How To Code
						Now, the first thing that you need to do - before you even think about enrolling in courses or starting to watch YouTube videos about coding - is to ask yourself why you want to learn to code.</p><br>

						<p>Step 2: Choose The Right Languages
						Different types of programming require different skills. For example, if you want to learn how to code a website, you should learn languages like HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript.</p><br>

						<p>Step 3: Choose The Right Resources To Help You Learn
						Now that we’ve looked at some of the most popular languages to help you discover how to code for beginners, it’s time to look at the best ways to learn them.</p><br>

						<p>Step 4: Download A Code Editor
						Although a lot of online courses let you write code in a code editor directly in your browser, you need to realize that this isn’t how it works in the real world. Once you graduate from your online course, you will need to start writing your code directly into a code editor, so it’s a good idea to start practicing doing this now.</p><br>

						<p>Step 5: Practice Writing Your Programs
						Once you have a basic working knowledge of your chosen language, you will need to start creating your programs and projects. Although you might feel that this is a long way away right now, you will be surprised how fast you progress once you start learning.</p>
